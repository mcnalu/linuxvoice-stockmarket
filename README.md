#Linux voice Stockmarket

This code was written for a tutorial that appeared in [Linux Voice](http://linuxvoice.com) issue 14.

Some points to note:

- it was developed and tested under Java 1.7, but shouldn't be too fussy about
  which java you used
- there are no dependencies, except CSVs of stockmarket data from Yahoo, as
  described in the Linux Voice article for details
- The main class is Stockmarket.java and it expects exactly one argument - 
  the path to where the CSV files are kept. 
- GPL v3 licensed
